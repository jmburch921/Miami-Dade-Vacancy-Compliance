# Miami-Dade-Vacancy-Compliance
This project is currently in development under contract with Miami-Dade County

Unfortunately, I cannot post the source code to GitHub

The purpose of this repo is to let recruiters and potential future employers know that I am working on this project.

If you would like to set up a meeting, I would be more than happy to display source code IN-PERSON (no video conferencing) or during an ON-SITE job interview.
